	I hold a PhD in English from the University of Miami, where I studied speculative fiction, fandom culture, online extremism, and digital humanities. My scholarship centers on networks and relationships, with a particular focus on the ways in which we interact with one another in online spaces and the artifacts we create and celebrate.

		<br>
	I am currently a postdoctoral researcher for <a href="https://interactive.miami.edu/connect/">CONNECT</a>, a collaboration between University of Miami and Indiana University which takes an interdisciplinary approach to studying online extremism. I have previously served as project manager for <a href="https://we1s.ucsb.edu/">WhatEvery1Says</a>, a project coordinated between UC Santa Barbara, CSU Northridge, and University of Miami which studies public discourse about the humanities at a large scale.
