	I hold a PhD in English at the University of Miami, where I studied speculative fiction, fandom culture, online extremism, and digital humanities. My scholarly interests tend to focus on networks and relationships, both within cultural artifacts such as books and visual media, as well as on a larger scale, as fans of these properties interact with one another and create artifacts of their own.

	I am currently a postdoctoral researcher for <a href="https://ulink.miami.edu/projects/society/extremism/index.html">CONNECT</a>, a collaboration between University of Miami and Indiana University which takes an interdisciplinary approach to studying online extremism. I have previously served as project manager for <a href="https://we1s.ucsb.edu/">WhatEvery1Says</a>, a project coordinated between UC Santa Barbara, CSU Northridge, and University of Miami which studies public discourse about the humanities at a large scale.
