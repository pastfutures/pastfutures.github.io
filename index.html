	<br>
	I am a December 2023 graduate in English at the University of Miami, where I studied speculative fiction, fandom culture, online extremism, and digital humanities. My scholarly interests tend to focus on networks and relationships, both within cultural artifacts such as books and visual media, as well as on a larger scale, as fans of these properties interact with one another and create artifacts of their own. 
	<br>
		<br>
	I am currently a research assistant for the U-LINK project <a href="https://ulink.miami.edu/projects/society/extremism/index.html">Countering online networked extremist conspiracy theories</a>. I have previously served as project manager for <a href="https://we1s.ucsb.edu/">WhatEvery1Says</a>, a project coordinated between UC Santa Barbara, CSU Northridge, and University of Miami which studies public discourse about the humanities at a large scale.

	You can also find me on <a href="http://www.instagram.com/past.futures/">Instagram</a>, where I post pictures of archival material, food, and as many cats as I can find. These days, it's primarily cats.
