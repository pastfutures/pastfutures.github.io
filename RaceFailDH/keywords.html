	<h2>Keyword Case Study</h2>
	<b>Top Keywords Across All Files</b>
	<br>
	<br>
  The second part of this study focuses on the prevalence of certain keywords within all files (posts and comments). Each file was cleaned, uploaded, and queried for most popular words via NVivo. NVivo has set parameters, including a minimum length of three letters and a preset list of "stop words" which includes terms like "she," "let's," and other fillers. In addition to using the preset stop words, I added a few recurring terms to the list, including "January," "reply," and "expand." These words appear frequently within each comment post, but far less frequently within the body text itself. The first graph below show the top ten words by total usage across all twenty files. The second shows words the top ten words recurring over most files. Nine words (person, other[ness], white, race, wrong, color, culture, black, and privilege) recur in both graphs. Two words (intended, dismiss) appear once in each.
