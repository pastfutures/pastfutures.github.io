	<h2>Keyword Case Study</h2>
	<b>Top Keywords Across All Files</b>
	<br>
	<br>
The second part of this study focuses on the prevalence of certain keywords within all files (posts and comments). Each file was cleaned, uploaded, and queried for most popular words via NVivo. NVivo has set parameters, including a minimum length of three letters and a preset list of "stop words" which includes terms like "she," "let's," and other fillers. In addition to using the preset stop words, I added a few recurring terms to the list, including "January," "reply," and "expand." These words appear frequently within each comment post, but far less frequently within the body text itself. The first graph below show the top ten words by total usage across all twenty files. The second shows words the top ten words recurring over most files. Nine words (person, other[ness], white, race, wrong, color, culture, black, and privilege) recur in both graphs. Two words (intended, dismiss) appear once in each.

	<b>Keywords: Black and White</b>	
	<br>
	<br>
Given that representations of race and marginalization lie at the heart of RaceFail '09, it is unsurprising that the abovementioned words are the most prevalent across all files. However, two words, black and white, stand out in not only their frequency but their relationship to one another. White appeared more frequently as a whole, 409 times versus 196 instances of black--almost twice as often. White also appears in one more file than black. In order to further explore instances of each word, I searched each comments file for the relationship between the two words.
