	<center><h1>Digital Project: Assessing RaceFail '09</h1></center>
	<b>Introduction</b>
<br>
<br>
In one month, it will have been ten years since the imbroglio referred to as RaceFail '09 first erupted. RaceFail '09 has been highly documented, both after and during the event, which stretched on for months, if not years. While, at first, it was tempting to lump RaceFail '09 in with other LiveJournal-based events, such as <a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/Strikethrough_and_Boldthrough">Strikethrough and Boldthrough</a>, RaceFail quickly became something much larger, not a <a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/Wank">wank</a> but a sea change in the depiction and discussion of race in SFF fandom.

For those who are unfamiliar with RaceFail '09, I strongly suggest the following descriptions and link round-ups:
<br>

<br>
- <a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/RaceFail_%2709">the FanLore entry on RaceFail '09</a>
<br>
<br>
It is sometimes difficult to fit all the pieces together this far in the future, given the migration from LiveJournal to Dreamwidth, locked posts, and the deletion of posts and profiles. While some posts are available through online archives, others have been screengrabbed or replicated as text by diligent fan archivists.
