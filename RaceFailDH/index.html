	<b>Introduction: RaceFail '09</b>
<br>
<br>
In one month, it will have been ten years since the imbroglio referred to as RaceFail '09 first erupted. RaceFail '09 has been highly documented, both after and during the event, which stretched on for months, if not years. While, at first, it was tempting to lump RaceFail '09 in with other LiveJournal-based events, such as <a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/Strikethrough_and_Boldthrough">Strikethrough and Boldthrough</a>, RaceFail quickly became something much larger, not a <a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/Wank">wank</a> but a sea change in the depiction and discussion of race in SFF fandom.

At the risk of adding Yet Another Post about RaceFail '09, I will briefly provide conext on this page before moving to the heart of my project. Many have written about RaceFail in far greater detail, and I strongly sugggest the links below, as they have been instrumental to my own research:
