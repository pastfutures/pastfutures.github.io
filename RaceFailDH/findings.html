	<b>Findings: Participants</b>
	<br>
	<br>
Of the ten selected posts, 628 unique users were identified across five sites:
	<br>
	- 372 users unique to LiveJournal (Elizabeth Bear [1 and 2], Teresa Nielsen Hayden, coffeeandink, sparkymonster, copracat)
	<br>
	- 158 users unique to WordPress (John Scalzi)
	<br>
	- 49 users unique to Blogspot (Avalon's Willow and N.K. Jemisin)
	<br>
	- 39 users unique to MetaFilter
	<br>
	- 7 users used multiple platforms
	<br>
	<br>
	Additionally, 24 anonymous comments were logged across 5 LiveJournal posts, and 4 deleted comments were logged across 4 LiveJournal posts. No data is available on the deleted posts, but we know that at least one of them is by N.K. Jemisin, whom Bear referred to as a commenter (username nojojojo)) in her first post.
	<br>
	<br>
	The lack of crossover between platforms is unsurprising, in part due to technological constraints, as LiveJournal did not yet have the capability for users to log in via Gmail, Facebook, or other sites. While Blogspot and InsaneJournal users had reciprocity, there was still not very much crossover, although Avalon's Willow is a notable exception. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Users did frequent multiple posts within LiveJournal, however, as the larger corpus of RaceFail '09 posts demonstrates. Within this set, 19 users commented on at least two different journals. For the most part, however, users within this data set stuck to one post (or, in the case of Elizabeth Bear, two).
