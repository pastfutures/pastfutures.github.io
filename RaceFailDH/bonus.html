	<center><h1>Special Features: Behind the Scenes with NVivo</h1>
  So I thought it might be fun to see what all this stuff looks like mid-process. Below are some screencaps of what my NVivo file looks like. I'm not advocating that this is what it <i>should</i> look like, but that's the fun part about experimentation.

The first image is a screenshot of all the files I imported into NVivo--note the posts split into two files, OP and comments. Originally, I used NCapture to import files directly from my browser, but this proved problematic, given the structure of LiveJournal posts with multiple pages of comments. In order to avoid duplicating the OP for each comments page, I instead copy-and-pasted the post into to separate Word docs.
