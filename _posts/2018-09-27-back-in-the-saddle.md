For the first time in about a decade, I have a site--and a blog. My last, and most successful, endeavor was on LiveJournal back in the day, but that platform is no longer viable (alas). Prior attempts to keep physical journals all display the same patterns: robust scribblings for about two to three weeks, a few intermittent scribbles, then a sea of blank pages.

This time, I'm hoping my work will keep me honest. I don't plan to update this blog daily, but instead hope to use it to showcase fun museum finds, upcoming events, and some of my current projects. Fingers crossed.
