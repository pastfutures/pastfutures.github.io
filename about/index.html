	<br>
	I am a third-year PhD student in English at the University of Miami, where I study speculative fiction, fandom culture, and digital humanities. My scholarly interests tend to focus on networks and relationships, both within cultural artifacts such as books and visual media, as well as on a larger scale, as fans of these properties interact with one another and create artifacts of their own. 
	<br>
	I am currently the UM Project Manger for <a href="https://we1s.ucsb.edu/">WhatEvery1Says</a>, a Mellon-funded project coordinated between UC Santa Barbara, CSU Northridge, and University of Miami which uses digital humanities methods to study public discourse about the humanities at large data scales.
